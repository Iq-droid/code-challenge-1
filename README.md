<!-- #2 Speeding Demerit Points Program -->

This program takes as input the speed of a car and calculates the number of demerit points a driver will receive if they exceed the speed limit.

## How to Use the Program
1. Enter the speed of the car when prompted.
2. The program will output a message indicating whether the speed was within the limit or not.
3.click the points button to get the output.
4. If the speed was above the limit, the program will calculate the number of demerit points and output it to the console.

## Program Logic

If the input speed is less than 70, the program will print "Ok".

If the input speed is greater than or equal to 70, the program will calculate the number of demerit points as follows:

- For every 5 km/s above the speed limit of 70, the driver will receive one demerit point.
- The total number of demerit points is the rounded integer value of the excess speed divided by 5.

The program will then output the total number of demerit points to the console.
